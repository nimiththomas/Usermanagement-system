# Usermanagement-system
This is a simple user management system created using php and html with mysql server as database.

Things to do
1.update db_connect with your mysql database details like name,password,host etc
2.update all a href to your domain name
ex: if your domain name is www.google.com update it into www.google.com/ums/index.html
if its locahost leave it unchanged


Run the system by opening index.html
